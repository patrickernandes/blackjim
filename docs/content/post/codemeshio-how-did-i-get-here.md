## Building Confidence in a Distributed Stream Processor

Video of my CodeMeshIO talk: ["How Did I Get Here? Building Confidence in a Distributed Stream Processor"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MsPDtpe2tg&index=3&list=PLWbHc_FXPo2hGJHXhpgqDU-P4BArpCdh6) is now available.

There's a number of links at the end of the talk for additional material you can check out. To make life easier on everyone I'm recreating it here.

If you are interested, I've made the [slides available on Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/seantallen/how-did-i-get-here-building-confidence-in-a-distributed-stream-processor-1). Like most of my talks, the slides aren't particularly good at standing on their own without the talk itself.
