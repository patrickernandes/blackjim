Almost two years ago, I embarked on a project that I had no idea the immensity of. And today, it has finally led to this:

![Storm Applied](/img/post/storm-applied-behind-the-scenes/storm-applied.jpg)

It started with my bugging [Matt Jankowski](https://twitter.com/mattjanks16) to write a ["mea culpa" blog post](http://dev.theladders.com/2013/03/riders-on-the-storm-take-a-long-holiday-let-your-children-play/) about our problems getting going with Storm at TheLadders. The idea was to start with a "boy we didn't know what we were doing" post and continue on with a series of posts about running Storm in a production. The first post happened, the rest never did. Instead, Manning reached out to Matt and before long, we were writing a book. 

I don't remember now what I envisioned the book being when we first signed the contract. I know that Storm Applied isn't that book but I'm quite happy with it nonetheless. There's a lot of hard earned lessons packed into the latter half of the book that I think will help a lot of people trying to run Storm in production. Hopefully our pain can benefit a lot of people. There's a ton of stories I could tell about writing the book, some good, some bad but I think I'll just leave you with a few "behind the scenes" vignettes:

* We really wanted to call the book _Thinking in Storm_ but there is already a _Thinking in ..._ series of books.
* I wanted to subtitle the book "I wanna go fast" but that got rejected. Still, [it sort of worked out.](http://manning.com/sallen/excerpt_contents.html)
* We intended to write "an advanced book" but ended up writing a book that starts as an intro and ends really advanced because there were no good intro Storm books in print.
* I spent WAY TOO MUCH TIME trying to work lines from [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A0-u85aAYg) into the book.
* Manning googled an Eleanor Roosevelt quote and made us change the attribution to "misquoted".

![Pretty sure Eleanor Roosevelt did say this](/content/images/2015/04/misquoted.png)

* Most of the content I wrote was written using [Write Room](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom). Full screen; no distractions = Awesome. Then Matt turned it into a "Manning usable" format because...
* Manning uses MS Word for manuscripts. I managed to get through the entire book without really knowing how to use Word thanks to Matt.
* The [source code for Chapter 6](https://github.com/Storm-Applied/C6-Flash-sale-recommender) got messed up and after the book had gone to press, I was working on recreating miss parts from what was in the chapter and memory.
* Whenever our editor mentioned "the publisher", it always sounded very mysterious; much like someone talking about Charlie from Charlie's Angels. 
* While writing Storm Applied, I [scientifically determined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ipGhzrIi3s&spfreload=10) that [The Jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOK_vqtXgbk) is the [best band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE1ct5yEuVY) to [listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-H0uIH5HHQ) to while [writing a book.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf4EFDGP4yg)
