## Scale Agnostic Python: How to scale your Python application without any code changes*

Unfortunately, there is no video of this talk. I am, however, planning on putting a record together of the topic. Slides are available. A full half of the presentation was a code walkthrough and a demo of a bit of the power that you can get from using a scale agnostic platform. If you are interested in the topic, I strongly advise you check out the Pat Helland paper below.
