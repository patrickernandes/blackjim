I recently did an [interview](https://lobste.rs/s/gheyhy/lobsters_interview_with_sean_t_allen) with the news aggregator site [lobste.rs](http://www.lobste.rs/). It covers some of what I've been up to in my role as [Principal Architect at TheLadders](http://dev.theladders.com/), as well as some info about my forthcoming book [Storm Applied](http://www.manning.com/sallen).
