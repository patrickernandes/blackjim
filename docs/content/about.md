I'm currently employed as VP of Architecture at [Wallaroo Labs](https://www.wallaroolabs.com). I'm a coauthor of [Storm Applied](http://manning.com/sallen/?a_aid=sallen). You can learn more about me (some of it is dated) from an interview I did with the website [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/s/gheyhy/lobsters_interview_with_sean_t_allen).
